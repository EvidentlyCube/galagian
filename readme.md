Galagian is a wave-based top-down shmup with bullet-hellish gameplay and a load of enemies.

When inspecting the source code please remember that this was the very first ActionScript 3.0 game I have ever made. It's dated and it's awful, it was slightly refactored to make it a bit more palatable but...

...bewere, here be dragons.

This repository contains the freely available source code and assets for the game by [Retrocade.net](http://retrocade.net).

## How to build the project

Open `build.cmd` in your text editor, update `MXMLC_PATH` variable with the path to Flex SDK (it should support at least Flash Player 10.1), and then run `build.cmd`. If you're on a non-windows o/s the commands used in the file should still work fine so you can use them as basis.
